/**
 * Due to floating point precision Java's (and thus Scala's by extension) trigonometric functions
 * return approximations of the actual mathematical values the functions "should" produce.
 *
 * In particular:
 *
 * cos/sin do not output 0 when expected.
 * eg while sin(Pi/2) is 1 sin(Pi) is very small but not 0.
 * While this is understandable, and fine for some purposes, it occasionally useful to have
 * these function output an actual 0.
 *
 * tan does not output Infinity at Pi/2 etc...
